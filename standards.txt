Vector field data structure:
s.Nx	- number of x locations
s.Ny	- number of y locations
s.x		- 2D (Nx by Ny) array of x locations. First index corresponds to x 
			location.
			For example, a 5x5 image with x locations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 would 
			have an s.x that looks like:
			s.x = [ 1 1 1 1 1 
			        2 2 2 2 2
					3 3 3 3 3
					4 4 4 4 4
					5 5 5 5 5 ];
			Notice that this is kinda backwards from the row/column format.
			But insures that everything is indexed (x,y)
			I just picked this, does anyone have comments?
s.y		- 2D array of y locations
s.u		- 2D array of u velocities
s.v		- 2D array of v velocities
s.dx	- the spacing between each x location
s.dy    - the spacing between each y location
Do we need variables for units?

Function header: something like this... note that the first line of comment 
will show up in the Matlab "details" pane, so try to give a good short 
description of the function

function [v d] = OrrSomerfeld( alpha, Re, N )
% numerically solves the Eigenvalue problem for the Orr-Somerfeld eq.
% well, at least it does for the given hw problem
% i.e. plane pouiselle flow in the domain y = -1 to +1
%      with U = 1 - y^2
% 
% Inputs:
%     - alpha is spatial wave number
%     - Re is the Reynolds number
%     - N specifies mesh size
% Output:
%     - c is a vector of complex eigenvalues
% Method:
%     - 2nd order central differencing inside the mesh
%     - 2nd order biased differencing at edge of mesh to include Neumann BC
%     - all BC's are zero, so there is no BC term
